# rps

Basic rps project in the command line. I have a big switch case and it was in the playRound() function, but I decided to move it to its own helper function to clean it up.

I'm also using the scores as global variables.

Also, I know you can use a object to make this easier, but I have not gotten there in the odin project yet, so I am not using it right now. 

Also I am not updating the CSS or HTML, this is simply all in the command line.
